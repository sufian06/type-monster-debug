                    <h3>1. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while
                        data in localStorage
                        doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a
                        document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
                        assigned to that particular tab</p>

                    <p><strong>Answer: </strong>Global variable - declared at the start of the program, their global
                        scope means they can be used in any procedure or subroutine in the program.
                        <br><br>
                        Local variable - declared within subroutines or programming blocks, their local scope means they
                        can only be used within the subroutine or program block they were declared in.
